## R7 - Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app<br>
My background has been 3d art for games, I also have two brothers that make music. I consider myself now to be in the process of becoming an independent game developer on the side whilst of course studying web development. My market place application will serve as a way to sell 3d art/assets to users that sign up.
Glowing Moth is my Indie name, and so it only makes sense to call my market place application the same. I have already sold assets on the Unity Asset Store, a very big market place for indie developers, however they take 30% of the sale. Using my own market place will dramatically reduce this cost, though I will obviously miss out on most of the traffic unity offers, I'm ok with this for the purpose of this assignment.

## R8 - Why is it a problem that needs solving?<br>
This is mainly a problem for myself regarding the fees I need to pay Unity Asset Store, however it may benefit the users that sign up, as I will be able to lower my prices, allowing other users/developers to purchase assets cheaper than they would normally be able to on the Unity Asset Store.

## R11 - Description of your marketplace app (website), including:
- **Purpose** - The main reason for the Glowing Moth Marketplace is to provide a way for myself to sell game assets that can be used by other indie game developers, and to reduce the cost that come with hosting them elsewhere.
- **Functionality / features** - Users have the ability to sign up and purchase assets. They can also change their password and or remove their account. There is a contact form to contact myself the admin. As an admin I can set what users have access to in terms of menu items. Currently as an admin I have the ability to upload assets that contain text descriptions, images and an attached file in the form of a zip, as well as being able to edit or delete an asset from being listed. After a user purchases an asset the can download the asset. The application is also mobile and tablet friendly.
